Read @01-manual/prompts/resources/02-phase-breakdown.md then use it to break down the PRP into phases. 

This is the prp @01-manual/results/prp.md. 

Write the phases into markdown format to 
@01-manual/results/phases/ as individual phase files, and create a phases overview file at @01-manual/results/phases/phases-overview.md.
